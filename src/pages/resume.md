### Sky - Global Identity and Access Management

**Performance Engineer** | Sep 2021 - Dec 2021

**Associate Performance Engineer** | Nov 2019 - Sept 2021

- **Sky Identity Platform:** Experience working with microservices infrastructure and ensuring optimal performance of Sky’s identity platform which has reached figures of up to 10 million concurrent users.
- **Peacock Streaming Service**: Worked on resilience improvements to the identity platform to enable usage for NBCUniversal’s customer base for the launch of its new streaming service. This project allowed me to develop expertise with DevOps solutions by deploying applications to cloud platforms utilizing Kubernetes, Jenkins, and other tools.
- **Developing new framework:** Key team member working on improvements to Sky’s new in-house performance testing framework and maintaining it as an open-source application. Changes provided the capability for a framework to be used for performance testing applications ranging from traditional backend microservices to message brokers such as RabbitMQ for volumes of up to 15 million concurrent users. This allowed me to work on developing cutting-edge solutions and concepts such as Chaos engineering and Failover testing.
- **Performance:** Making sure new versions of identity platform applications meet the performance benchmarks. Taking and deciding on appropriate actions such as scaling up deployment services, resource allocation, and load balancing to improve the performance of web requests.
- **CI/CD:** Making sure the correct versions of applications are deployed through the pipeline to the right staging environments before production with Jenkins. Capable of doing rollbacks and handling deployments.
- **Python:** Extensive experience with Python, including asynchronous programming, dealing with complex data structures, and abstractions. Experienced in maintaining codebases with PyTest.
- **Agile development:** The work process is mainly driven by a kanban system via Jira. Comfortable with feature kick-offs, daily standups, Scrum of scrums, estimation meetings, and other common Agile ways of working. Also had the opportunity to formulate technical solutions based on project requirements given by product owners.
- **Pair programming:** Trained new starters to get comfortable with the codebase and workflow.

**Arup – MEICA Team, Energy & Resources**

*Mechanical Consulting Intern Jul 19 – Aug 19*

- **First-hand experience:** Worked as a summer placement student in the MEICA team at Arup. Experience involved learning about the conception, design and delivery phases of various projects including Wastewater Treatments, Tidal Energy Plants, Energy Storage Systems and Sludge Incineration. Assisted design engineers with calculations for tidal turbine and pump efficiencies for a Tidal Barrage project.
- **Digital & Automation:** Helped develop code that aided in the automation of design check calculations using programming tools such as C# and Gitlab for DevOps.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Assisted with Arup’s marketing schemes for Energy storage. This included compiling all of Arup’s energy storage projects, and extensive research to update Arup’s electrical energy storage technology guides as a tool to showcase Arup’s multidisciplinary capabilities to clients.
- **Commercial awareness:** Developed an understanding of how Arup works closely with their clients; the importance of the bidding process to secure projects; the importance of understanding customer requirements and complying with regulations, and; the need to find a balance between cost-effectiveness for a client and optimal design considerations.
